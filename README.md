##  :raising_hand: Introduction
This repository was created for recruitment at Dazn. I'm applying  for the JavaScript Web Developer.  
Main objective is implement User interface witch allows users to search Movie DB.  
The user should be able to enter some text into a search field, see and browser the results from the Movie DB.  
  [The Movie Database API](https://themoviedb.docs.apiary.io/#) should be used as data provider.

## :sun_with_face: Word of the author
I use a public API with restrictions - only data from 1000 pages can be seen.  
I don't block the possibility of browsing next pages because  
I want to give you the opportunity to test error handling.  
  
I did not use any external libs excluding React, Styled-Components and testing libraries.  
You can find redux in package.json, but it was used only for testing purposes.  

I use my own library - Houx to manage the state.  
[You can read more here.](https://github.com/glaskawiec/houx)

I did not put comments in the code because I believe that the clearly written code documents itself.
